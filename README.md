RICK AND MORTY FAN PAGE.

  This originally started as a boot camp project. We were supposed to show
that we could successfully manage an api.  I did okay my first go around
but I enjoyed the project and knew I could do better. I went back after 
boot camp ended and made a new site from the ground up.

 Features - 
 
     A multi page character section with a search bar and a toggle functio
to show more information on individual characters.
           
     A random quote generator built from a array of objects.

 What I used - 
    
    React
    
    Styled-Components
    
    React-Router-Dom
    
    Axios
    
    NPM

 
 The process - 

I used create-react-app and npm to get the project started. I built the 
site around a free Rick and Morty API available online. I used Axios to 
handle the API    data and made a character section that was multi page an
included a search bar and page numbers. I added a toggle function that 
allowed a person to click an individual character and have extra 
information about them open and close. 
    
I used React-Router-Dom within the app.js component to set up the routes t
my pages and then used Links within the nav to access them.

I created an array of objects that I randomized to make the quote 
generator. I plan to add to it in time or else make it into an API

The whole site was styled with Styled-Components
